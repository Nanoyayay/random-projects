 If this looks like a bunch of ones and zeros, get a programmer to help you.
Calc.PY
 A basic calculator
 Add, subtract, divide or multiply numbers.
 Many things you do may cause a syntax error. Don't worry about it, unless you do something like "1+1" and get one. Contact me if that happens.
 You are NOT able to set variables, this isn't a scientific calculator. If you do "x = 1", it won't work. Try doing "x" and you'll get hit with an error saying "not denified."
HackPrank.HTML
 Just a html script to prank friends. Does nothing malicious.
 A rainbow text appears saying "haha u hav been heked"
 Then there is a button that says "unhek me" and upon clicking explodes everything.
 Just the website. Nothing else.
 Good to prank friends.
 ..please do not take this seriously.
